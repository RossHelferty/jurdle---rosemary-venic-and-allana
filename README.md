    When you guys are putting things into the main file,  I would prefer if you could copy & paste it through codespace so that things don't get overwritten, if possible.

  Haiiii guyss :3 
  <br>
  Alannna, I think that your attempt to sync your branch has resulted in all of the stuff I added yesterday to disappear.

<p><b>Hello guys, I already finished the codes for almost everything but the optional functions, however, its quite different from the notes that rosemary left. The only thing left to do is add more words (which I'm going to continue doing) and if we want to, the optional stuff (I already made a menu button for this, but I can just remove it later on if we decide on not adding the optional stuff). Please check my branch, if you guys think that the codes are good enough, I'll transfer it to the main branch. I'm afraid that directly pasting it to the main branch will overwrite rosemarys notes especially that mine is quite different from it. Thank you ^^ </b>

If you guys have any questions for me please email me so that I can respond much faster, below is my school email.

<p>stuff rosemary's doing:</p>
<p>- main function that focuses on the game aspect of worldle (ie. recognising words through arrays & stuff)</p>
<br>
<p>stuff venice is doing:</p>
<p>- css & typing to interact with game</p>
<br>
<p>stuff alanna can do:</p>
<p>- help with rosemary's functions in rosemary's branch</p>
<p>- thourghly beta-test everything</p>
<p>- it'd be really awesome if you could create a navigation box / main menu that includes a button that calls the promptUser() function so that they can see the how-to again in case they forgot how to play</p>
